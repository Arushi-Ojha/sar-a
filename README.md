SAR-A: Multi-frequency, multi-polarization fusion + physics-aware change-detector for coastal resilience — fuse L-band, S-band and airborne polarimetric SAR (UAVSAR/RCM/Sentinel-1) to automatically detect, classify, and attribute coastal change drivers (storm surge flooding, land subsidence, vegetation loss, saltwater intrusion) and produce stakeholder-ready decision products (inundation maps, driver attribution reports, StoryMap + interactive web viewer).

Why this is badass: it fuses multi-frequency physics (penetration vs canopy), polarimetric signatures (VV/VH/HH/HV), time series InSAR/coherence, and environmental models (tide & storm surge) to attribute cause — not just “what changed” but why it changed. Agencies care about attribution for response/mitigation.

Why this meets the NASA brief

Uses multi-frequency (L + S + C where available) and multi-polarization SAR. ✅

Select a compelling study area (coastal city with recent storms + subsidence risk) so you can link to societal relevance and ancillary data (tide gauges, population). ✅

Produces story-driven visualizations (StoryMap, interactive web map, slider comparisons) and hypotheses about physical drivers (flood vs subsidence vs vegetation loss). ✅

Make it (appear) impossible for a student — but still doable for you

Strategy: combine advanced elements that are uncommon in student projects, and package them into an integrated, reproducible pipeline:

Physics-aware multi-frequency fusion layer — implement a custom fusion that weights backscatter and coherence by wavelength penetration properties and polarization scattering models (e.g., treat L-band as vegetation-penetrating for root/soil signals, S/C bands for canopy/surface). This is more sophisticated than simple RGB composites.

Automated attribution engine — build a rules + ML hybrid that ingests SAR signatures, InSAR vertical displacement time series, tidal/storm metadata, and ancillary land cover to attribute detected change to one of: storm surge, permanent inundation (sea level / subsidence), vegetation removal (deforestation / harvest / fire), or soil moisture change.

Operational pipeline + data cube — create a temporal SAR data cube (spatio-temporal tiling, multiband, polarization) and a job system to compute coherence/InSAR per tile. Provide archival indexes and precomputed thumbnails — this is engineering heavy and uncommon for students.

Stakeholder validation — integrate tide gauge records, local DEM/land use, and optionally crowdsourced photos (or Google Street View) to validate attribution. This makes the project useful to agencies.

Polished deliverables — interactive StoryMap + web app + reproducible code + precomputed Docker image or binder — makes it look like a mini operational product.

These steps raise the bar well beyond a typical student project. But — and this is key — you don’t need to run expensive compute locally. Offload.

Concrete architecture (what to build)

High-level components:

Data layer

SAR inputs: Sentinel-1 (C-band, VV/VH), ASF-hosted L-band (UAVSAR or archived L-band), and any available S-band (NISAR once available / RCM where permitted). Use Vertex & Earthdata. 
search.asf.alaska.edu

Ancillary: DEM (SRTM), tidal gauge time series (local), precipitation & wind reanalysis (ERA5), landcover (MODIS/ESA CCI), population layer.

Processing / compute

Preprocessing: orbit correction, thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, speckle filtering (SNAP/pyroSAR/Sentinel-1 toolbox).

Geocoding & resampling to common grid (rasterio, GDAL).

Time series building: stack SAR images into a data cube per tile.

InSAR & coherence: use SNAP + ISCE or PySAR wrapper to compute displacement/coherence time series.

Polarimetric indices: produce HV/HH/VV ratio composites, Pauli/Cloude–Pottier decompositions for structure.

Fusion & attribution model: custom Python pipeline (xarray + dask) that computes physics-weighted fusion features then applies attribution logic (rules + small classifier).

Modeling / attribution

Rule layer: if coherence drops + sudden negative displacement timed with storm => likely storm-induced inundation.

ML layer (optional): train a lightweight classifier (random forest / small CNN on patches) on labeled events (use historical floods / subsidence cases). Use physics features (coherence, displacement slope, polarization ratios) as inputs.

Frontend & storytelling

Static StoryMap (ArcGIS StoryMaps or an html story) that uses slider, animated time-lapse, and an embedded web map.

Interactive web app: React + MapLibre GL showing tiled precomputed rasters, time slider, classification overlays, and an “Why did this change?” panel with attribution explanation. Keep heavy tiles precomputed on cloud storage (S3 / GCS) and stream them.

Deliverables / reproducible artifacts

Jupyter notebook (with small sample tiles) that runs on your laptop or in Binder/Colab.

Precomputed dataset + Docker container for reviewer demonstration (so they can run a demo without heavy compute).

StoryMap + 5–10 minute narrated video demo.

One-page “applications to NASA/ISRO” white paper.

How to make it uniquely yours (hard to copy)

Custom fusion algorithm: implement a mathematically-motivated weighting by wavelength + polarization (document derivation). Most students just stack images or RGB; you’ll publish a small appendix deriving why you weight bands the way you do (physics + citation to SAR literature).

Attribution explainability: output human-readable evidence chains (e.g., “drop in coherence 2025-07-31 → magnitude 5 cm subsidence across tile → coincident with tidal peak, but no vegetation loss signature → classified as temporary storm inundation”). Structured explanations are rare.

Local stakeholder tie-ins: collect a small ground truth dataset (e.g., a local tide gauge + a photo or a municipal report) and show your system correctly attributes a recent event. This operational tie is often missing in student entries.

Proprietary precomputed indices: create novel indices (e.g., “L-S penetration contrast index”) you invent; include code and explain parameters. Unique indices + documentation makes reproduction nontrivial.

Engineering polish: data cube, tiling, job orchestration, and a public demo with precomputed tiles — engineering is what separates research prototypes from "student final projects".

I can’t guarantee no one else will try something similar, but these five elements give your project a distinctive intellectual and engineering fingerprint.
